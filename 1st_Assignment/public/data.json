    "<p>NPM is the package manager for the Node JavaScript platform. ",
    "It puts modules in place so that node can find them, and manages dependency conflicts intelligently. ",
    "It is extremely configurable to support a wide variety of use cases. ",
    "Most commonly, it is used to publish, discover, install, and develop node programs.</p>",
    "<p>The main purpose of using npm is automated dependency and package management. ",
    "This means that you can specify all of your project's dependencies inside your <code>package.json</code> file. ",
    "Afterwards, when you want to get started with the project, all you need to do is running the command <code> npm install </code> and have all of the dependencies installed. </p>",
    "<p>It is also possible to manually download the libraries you need to use while developing. ",
    "However, as your project grows, this proccess will become time-consuming and messy. ",
    "Furthermore, it also makes collaborating and sharing your project much more difficult.</p>",
